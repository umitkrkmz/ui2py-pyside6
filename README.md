## ✨ Features

- **Batch Conversion:** Convert multiple `.ui` files to `.py` files at once.
- **Drag & Drop Support:** Simply drag your `.ui` files onto the application window.
- **Automatic Naming:** Output files are intelligently named `ui_<filename>.py`.
- **Customizable Output:** For single files, you can easily edit the output name.
- **Dark/Light Theme:** The application automatically adapts to your system's theme.
- **Real-time Status Updates:** Clear feedback during the conversion process.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 📥 Installation

You can run the application directly using the executable or run it from the source code.

### Option 1: Standalone Executable (Recommended)
No Python installation required! Perfect for quick usage.

1. Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/umitkrkmz/ui2py-pyside6/releases)** page.
2. Download the latest `ui2py.exe`.
3. Double-click to run. That's it!

### Option 2: Running from Source
If you are a developer and want to modify the code:

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # Create
   python -m venv .venv
   # Activate (Windows)
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # Activate (macOS/Linux)
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install the dependency:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   python ui2py.py
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

1.  **Select File(s)** — Click *Select File* or drag & drop one or more `.ui` files into the window.
2.  **(Optional)** Select a destination folder. By default, it's the same folder as the input file(s).
3.  **(Optional, single file only)** Edit the output name.
4.  Click **Convert**. Status updates will appear at the bottom.

> 💡 *Tip:* When converting multiple files, each one is automatically named as `ui_<filename>.py`.

## 📝 Changelog
- **v1.4.1:** Added the ability to remove selected files from the multi-file list.
- **v1.4:** Added automatic dark/light theme support that adapts to the system in real time.
- **v1.3:** Introduced multi-file batch conversion and a dynamic UI that resizes to show a file list.
- **v1.2:** Implemented drag-and-drop support and a smarter, segmented output path editor.
- **v1.1:** Added better error handling and fixed taskbar visibility.
- **v1.0:** Initial release with basic single-file conversion.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- **`pyside6-uic not found on PATH`** Make sure PySide6 tools are installed and your terminal can run `pyside6-uic`.

- **No permission to write file** Choose a folder where you have write permissions (e.g., your home or desktop folder).

- **Wrong file type** Only `.ui` files are supported.

- **Mixed file types dropped** Only `.ui` files will be processed. Other file types will be ignored.

- **Duplicate output names** Output names are auto-generated as `ui_<filename>.py`. Ensure all input filenames are unique to avoid overwriting.
